            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe SeÅ¿Å¿ions for <hi>London</hi> and <hi>MiddleÅ¿ex</hi> began <hi>May</hi> the 26th, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the 28th, where were in all Condemned fourteen perÅ¿ons, four Women and ten Men; all which women were by a Jury of Matrons found Å¿everally to be quick with Child, and Å¿o Reprieved till they were Delivered; and of the men five alÅ¿o, who had not Å¿o notoriouÅ¿ly offended, as to be totally excluded from Mercy, were put by and exempted from the Severity of JuÅ¿tice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Newel</hi> and <hi>John Biggs</hi> had formerly been notoriouÅ¿ly Guilty of divers Burglaries, and particularly of breaking out of the Goal of <hi>Newgate,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on new Facts ImpriÅ¿oned at St. <hi>Albans,</hi> they were thence removed; and had not the confidence to plead otherwiÅ¿e than Guilty, as well knowing there were Å¿o many Indictments againÅ¿t them, as would certainly do their buÅ¿ineÅ¿s.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Eakins</hi> was one of the Å¿ame Crew, an old Malefactor, who Å¿o oft had received Mercy, that now he could expect or hope for it no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard Spykeman</hi> was alÅ¿o Condemned for Burglary, having run through the whole courÅ¿e or Å¿tage of Villany. He began firÅ¿t with <hi>Dear-Å¿tealing,</hi> and as the leaÅ¿t Rogueries tranÅ¿acted with Impunity, prompt on to the <hi>greateÅ¿t,</hi> and Å¿ingle, Å¿mall, vicious Attempts grow up in time to be perfect Habits; Å¿o he after various over-paÅ¿t Crimes, having been a Water-pad, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> became Å¿o far hardned, as not to Å¿tick at any nefarious Acts whatÅ¿oever; and therefore as an
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:191843:2"/> 
               <hi>Incorrigible</hi> Offender, was now thought fit to be <hi>mow'd</hi> down by the <hi>Scythe</hi> of JuÅ¿tice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George D.</hi> was an Officer belonging to the <hi>MarÅ¿hals-Court:</hi> his crime, for killing the Child of a poor Man; (whom he ArreÅ¿ted) becauÅ¿e it cryed out to Å¿ee its Father miÅ¿-uÅ¿ed. At the time of his Condemnation, he Å¿eemed very <hi>remorÅ¿eful</hi> for his Offence, but afterwards appeared (as Å¿ome Å¿uppoÅ¿ed) more <hi>expectant</hi> and Å¿ollicitous for a <hi>Temporal,</hi> than any other <hi>Pardon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Å¿ubÅ¿tance of the Å¿everal Crimes as were found at the SeÅ¿Å¿ions were as follows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A remarkable Tryal was about the Murder of a ConÅ¿table at the <hi>Armitage-Å¿tairs,</hi> for which a poor Waterman Å¿tood Indicted; there were abundance of WitneÅ¿Å¿es examined, and the Tryal was very tedious. But the Å¿um of the matter was to this effect: Some <hi>Scotchmen,</hi> half a dozen or more in all, belonging to a Ship that lay in the River, having been on Å¿hore, and 'tis probable taking plentiful Cups, as Sailors uÅ¿e, about nine of the Clock at night were returning to their VeÅ¿Å¿el; and in order to get to their own Boat, Å¿ome of them Å¿tept through a Boat of the PriÅ¿oners, in which there was a Boy, whom a <hi>Scotch</hi> boy of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany either trod upon or affronted, which made him Å¿trike him; and the Scotchmen as faÅ¿t fell on the <hi>EngliÅ¿h-boy,</hi> who ran and called his MaÅ¿ter the PriÅ¿oner, and Å¿o the Fray encreaÅ¿ed: to quell which, the now PriÅ¿oner called the ConÅ¿table living juÅ¿t by, and who was his intimate Friend; for at his houÅ¿e he uÅ¿ed commonly to leave Å¿everal Tackling belonging to his Boat, and other offices of KindneÅ¿s frequently paÅ¿s'd between them. But Å¿o it hapned in the Scuffle, it being pretty dark, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿table's Brains were beat out, Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be done with one of their Poies, or Hooks, which they uÅ¿e with their Boats. The <hi>Scotchmen</hi> Å¿hifted for themÅ¿elves and got away, and a perÅ¿on that was there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that the now PriÅ¿oner Å¿truck the fatal Blow; but beÅ¿ides that there was no former Malice, Å¿o 'twas a moÅ¿t unlikely thing, that he Å¿hould go to hurt one that was his Friend, and came thither at his requeÅ¿t to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t him. So that upon the whole matter, it was believed Å¿uch witneÅ¿s might poÅ¿Å¿ibly be miÅ¿taken, in Å¿o great an Hurry and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion; Å¿o that the Waterman, who had the repute of an honeÅ¿t, civil, quiet man amongÅ¿t his Neighbours, was Acquitted.</p>
            <p>A PerÅ¿on was Convicted for a Robbery in <hi>MiddleÅ¿ex,</hi> committed in a Victualling-houÅ¿e that Å¿tood alone, remote from Neighbours, whither the PriÅ¿oner, for Å¿ome time before the Exploit was committed, uÅ¿ed for Å¿ome days frequently to reÅ¿ort, and Å¿eem'd a very civil GueÅ¿t: but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving laid the DeÅ¿ign, he and two or three more of his Companions came one Evening, about 9 or 10 of the Clock, before the Doors were Å¿hut, there being no body there but the Woman of the houÅ¿e and her Maid; where preÅ¿ently Å¿wearing in a furious manner, they begun to demand her Keys, and this Fellow held the Woman below, whilÅ¿t the reÅ¿t went up Å¿tairs and ranÅ¿ackt her Trunks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> taking away in Money and Goods to the value of near Twenty Pounds; and then binding the Woman and her Servant, went away with the Booty. The Woman, whilÅ¿t the reÅ¿t were making havock above, Å¿eeing her Å¿elf like to be quite undone, wept bitterly, and Å¿aid to the now PriÅ¿oner who held her below, <hi>Alas, Sir, I did not imagine that you would have dealt thus by me!</hi> To which all the AnÅ¿wer the hard-hearted Villain returned, was with a Å¿cornful Smile, <hi>No indeed Landlady, I believe you did not.</hi> He had then a Perriwig on, and other Cloaths, but the Woman knew him by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:191843:2"/> his Voice; and the Maid Å¿wore directy that he was the man: And Å¿o he was found Guilty.</p>
            <p>An old fellow, one of thoÅ¿e that broke out of the Goal, and upon their retaking at St. <hi>Albons</hi> being brought up, were publickly expoÅ¿ed with Collars about their Necks, to the view of the people without <hi>Newgate,</hi> having now Å¿everal Indictments againÅ¿t him; when he was required to plead to the firÅ¿t, Å¿aid, He was Guilty of that and whatÅ¿oever elÅ¿e Å¿hould be brought againÅ¿t him; and being thereupon asked, Why he would plead Å¿o unadviÅ¿edly, and whether he had a minde to caÅ¿t away his Life, anÅ¿wered, That he were as good caÅ¿t it away himÅ¿elf, for he was Å¿ure he Å¿hould be Hang'd. And indeed he had no reaÅ¿on to promiÅ¿e himÅ¿elf a better DeÅ¿tiny, for he had been a notorious HouÅ¿ebreaker, and the occaÅ¿ion of many other mens ruine, by his bad Example, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious CounÅ¿el and Enticement.</p>
            <p>A kind of DiÅ¿tracted Woman was Arraigned for Å¿tealing a great Å¿um of Money; but Å¿he Å¿eemed to take no notice of, nor underÅ¿tand any thing that was Å¿aid againÅ¿t her; and the Officers of the Jail affirmed, that ever Å¿ince her Commitment, Å¿he appeared to them as a perÅ¿on Lunatick, or not <hi>compos mentis;</hi> and therefore in reÅ¿pect of her condition Å¿he was Å¿et aÅ¿ide.</p>
            <p>A young man was found guilty of a Felony and Burghlary in <hi>London,</hi> breaking into an HouÅ¿e that he was well acquainted at in the night, and Å¿tealing thence a Gold Watch and other things, to the value of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds and upwards.</p>
            <p>A Bailey belonging to the MarÅ¿hals-Court, going to ArreÅ¿t a poor man for a Debt of Å¿even Å¿hillings, and according to the uÅ¿ual Cruelty and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouÅ¿neÅ¿s of thoÅ¿e Å¿avage Cattle, beating and dragging him along; a Child of the mans, Å¿eeing her Father Å¿o uÅ¿ed, cryed out: whereupon this brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiÅ¿h fellow turn'd about and Å¿truck the poor Child a blow on the head with a great Cudgel, Å¿o furiouÅ¿ly, that a Gentleman that Å¿aw it, teÅ¿tified it was enough to have knockt down the Å¿touteÅ¿t man. However, the Child was for the preÅ¿ent recovered to life, and by the help of a Surgeon, the Wound in Å¿ome time Å¿eemed to be healed, but Å¿till Å¿he complained of her Head, and Å¿eemed to languiÅ¿h ever after, and not long after dyed; Å¿o that it was concluded he was the occaÅ¿ion of her death, and accordingly the Jury found him guilty.</p>
            <p>An Ale-houÅ¿e-keeper was likewiÅ¿e Indicted for killing a poor weak man, whom 'twas Å¿aid he kickt; but the proof not being poÅ¿itive, and the party deceaÅ¿ed having long been known to be very infirm, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</p>
            <p>Two Shop-lifts were Convicted of Felony for Å¿tealing of three pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Damask Silk out of a Å¿hop in <hi>London,</hi> where they came pretending to buy Diaper, and whilÅ¿t the man went to reach it, they got the Å¿ilk; but he Å¿oon miÅ¿Å¿ed it, and purÅ¿uing them, they according to the uÅ¿ual tricks of Practitioners in that MyÅ¿tery were Å¿een to drop it.</p>
            <p>A Woman that came to be a Servant in a Gentlemans houÅ¿e, before Å¿he had been there five days, took an opportunity to Rob them of a conÅ¿iderable parcel of Plate and Å¿ome Money, and carried it down into the Countrey by a Carrier; being diÅ¿covered, was now Indicted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Å¿aid Carrier, and Å¿he was found Guilty: but the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier being a very honeÅ¿t man, and nothing Criminal proved againÅ¿t him, was deÅ¿ervedly Acquitted.</p>
